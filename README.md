# Keys Helper - By Ryan Murphy
Thank you for taking a look at my Android app! This is my first solo project since I graduated from university and has been a great learning experience for me. I used Java and XML through Android Studio to make this application possible.

Keys Helper is a simple app that can be used for learning keyboard and piano, or even as a reference tool for the more experienced!

*Keys Helper is available for download on Google Play Store - searching for MurphDev will be the easiest way to find it*

## Compatibility

Keys Helper is an Android application - so it will only work on Android devices. It requires a large amount of screen space in order to show the full keyboard - this means that older smartphones with smaller resolutions may unfortunately run into problems (such as the full keyboard not showing on-screen). 

Keys Helper is primarily developed to work on smartphones rather than tablets, however, it will still function normally on a tablet as well.

### Issues?
Feel free to open any issues that are persistent within the app and I will do my best to address them as soon as possible.

Thank you for your support and I hope you enjoy learning with Keys Helper!
