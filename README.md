# KeysNewb - By Ryan Murphy
Thank you for taking a look at my Android app! This is my first solo project since I graduated from university and has been a great learning experience for me. I used Java and XML through Android Studio to make this application possible.

KeysNewb is a simple app that can be used for learning keyboard and piano, or even as a reference tool for the more experienced!

## Compatibility

KeysNewb is an Android application - so it will only work on Android devices. It requires a large amount of screen space in order to show the full keyboard - this means that older smartphones with smaller resolutions may unfortunately run into problems (such as the full keyboard not showing on-screen). 

For devices that run into screen space issues - the app still has basic functionality, however, the quiz game may not run as intended. I have extensively tested this on modern devices (Galaxy S8 and smartphones released around this time and after) and haven't run into any issues.

KeysNewb is primarily developed to work on smartphones rather than tablets, however, it will still function normally on a tablet as well.

## Installation

1. Downloading using a computer: Download KeysNewb.apk located in master and then plug the Android device into the computer. Transfer the apk file into the "Downloads" folder onto the device

   Downloading using an Android device: Download KeysNewb.apk located in master. The saved apk file will by default be saved to the "Downloads" folder onto the device

2. Open the Android app "My Files", or something along the lines of which allows you to browse data that is stored on the device. If there is no shortcut for "Installation APKs", navigate to the "Downloads" folder and KeysNewb.apk will be listed

3. Click on it and allow "My Files" to install unknown apps. No special permissions are required to use KeysNewb and it does not have any networking capability

4. Once installed, it's suggested to go back and turn off installation from unknown apps. This can be accomplished by going into the "Settings" app -> type "Install unknown apps" into the search bar -> Click on it and navigate to "My Files" and uncheck "Allow from this source"

### Issues?
Feel free to open any issues that are persistent within the app and I will do my best to address them as soon as possible.

Thank you for your support and I hope you enjoy learning with KeysNewb!
